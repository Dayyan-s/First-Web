            <h2>What is programming language?</h2>
            <i>A programming language is a set of instructions that can be used to interact with and control a computer.
                These languages are used to design websites, create apps, develop operating systems, control spacecraft,
                and analyze data. Programming languages are necessary because computers can't understand Engish.
                Programming languages bridge this gap by helping programmers translate their commands into something
                that the computer can understand and execute.</i><br>

            <h2>Type of programming language</h2>
            <p>
            <i>
                There are three types of programming languages: machine language, assembly language, and high-level
                language.

                Machine language is easier for the computer to understand but harder for the programmer to understand.
                This is because machine language is simply the language of machinesâ€”bits. Sometimes, programmers will
                develop programs directly with machine code, but because this is difficult to understand and tedious to
                type, it is more common to program using assembly or a high-level language. Assembly language is
                slightly easier to understand. The bits of machine language are replaced by numbers and English
                commands. Before assembly code is run by the computer, it is assembled by an assembler. This converts
                the code back into the 1s and 0s of machine language that the computer can understand.

                High-Level languages use many more English commands and are significantly more readable than assembly or
                machine language. Many high-level languages have built-in commands that help the programmer write loops,
                create variables of different data types, and manipulate strings. It is worth noting that all of these
                are possible in assembly or machine language, but high-level languages make them much easier for the
                programmer to read, write, and debug. Some newer high-level languages are scripting languages. This
                means that they are not compiled, or translated into machine language, until just before the code is
                executed at runtime. Python, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, and Bash are all scripting languages.
